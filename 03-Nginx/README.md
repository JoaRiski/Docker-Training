# Exposing Nginx

## Objective

* Run a docker container based on the `nginx` container image.
* Expose the Nginx port from the container to the host.
* Use the `docker ps` command to view the status of running containers.
* Use the `docker stop` command to stop the nginx container.

## To-do

* Run `docker run --rm --name nginx -d -p 8080:80 nginx` on your terminal.
    * The `--rm` flag will make docker remove the container automatically once it exits. If this is not used, it can also be manually removed with `docker container rm NAME`.
    * The `--name NAME` option will set the container's name to the provided value. This can later on be used to refer to the container when running commands against it.
    * The `-d` flag will make the container run in the background.
    * The `-p HOSTPORT:CONTAINERPORT` will publish the `CONTAINERPORT` port from within the containere and make it available at `HOSTPORT` on the host.
        * You can (and should) also define the host address, unless intending to expose the service publicly. This can be done with `-p LISTENADDRESS:HOSTPORT:CONTAINERPORT`.
        * For example: `-p 127.0.0.1:8080:80`.
* Run `docker ps` and make sure the nginx container is running.
* Navigate to `http://localhost/8080` on your browser and ensure you are greeted with the `Welcome to nginx!` message.
* Run `docker stop nginx` to stop the nginx container.
    * Here we can refer to the container as `nginx`, as we earlier defined that to be the container's name with the `--name nginx` option.
* Run `docker ps` and make sure the nginx container has stopped.
